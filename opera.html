    <h3>The Grand Duke</h3>
    <h4>ACT II
        Same Scene. Night. Awning removed. Moonlight. CAPTAIN
      discovered
           singing on poop deck, and accompanying himself on a
      mandolin. LITTLE
           BUTTERCUP seated on quarterdeck, gazing sentimentally at
      him.
    </h4>
    <P> BUT-        
        Things are seldom what they seem,
        Skim milk masquerades as cream;
        Highlows pass as patent leathers;
        Jackdaws strut in peacock's feathers.
        CAPT. (puzzled). Very true,
            So they do.</P>
    <P> CAPT -       
        Though I'm anything but clever,
                I could talk like that for ever:
                Once a cat was killed by care;
                Only brave deserve the fair.
                        Very true,
                        So they do.</P>
     <P>SIR JOSEPH-
        That is really a very sensible suggestion, and
                            displays
                            more knowledge of human nature than I had given you credit for.</P>
    <P> JOS-           
        Never mind the why and wherefore,
         Love can level ranks, and therefore
         I admit the jurisdiction;
          Ably have you played your part;
        You have carried firm conviction
        To my hesitating heart.</P>
    <P>DICK -      
        Kind Captain, I've important information,
            Sing hey, the kind commander that you are,
    About a certain intimate relation,
       Sing hey, the merry maiden and the tar.</P>
       <P>CREW-                 
         Now, hark at that, do!
                           Though foes we could thump any,
                           We are scarcely fit company
                             For a lady like you!</P>
    <P> RALPH-            
          Proud officer, that haughty lip uncurl!
                                Vain man, suppress that supercilious sneer,
                           For I have dared to love your matchless girl,
                              A fact well known to all my messmates here!</P>
