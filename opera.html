      discovered

    <h6>BUT-</h6> 
    <P>     
        Things are seldom what they seem,
        Skim milk masquerades as cream;
        Highlows pass as patent leathers;
        Jackdaws strut in peacock's feathers.
        CAPT. 
        
    <p>(puzzled).</p> 
    
    Very true,
            So they do.
    </P>
    <H6>CAPT -</H6>
    <P>        
        Though I'm anything but clever,
                I could talk like that for ever:
                Once a cat was killed by care;
                Only brave deserve the fair.
                        Very true,
                        So they do.</P>
     <h6>SIR JOSEPH-</h6>                   
     <P>
        That is really a very sensible suggestion, and
                            displays
                            more knowledge of human nature than I had given you credit for.</P>
    <h6>JOS-</h6>                         
    <P>          
        Never mind the why and wherefore,
         Love can level ranks, and therefore
         I admit the jurisdiction;
          Ably have you played your part;
        You have carried firm conviction
        To my hesitating heart.</P>
    <h6>DICK -</h6>     
    <P>     
        Kind Captain, I've important information,
            Sing hey, the kind commander that you are,
    About a certain intimate relation,
       Sing hey, the merry maiden and the tar.</P>
       <h6>CREW- </h6>
       <P>                
         Now, hark at that, do!
                           Though foes we could thump any,
                           We are scarcely fit company
                             For a lady like you!</P>
     <h6>RALPH-</h6>                        
    <P>             
          Proud officer, that haughty lip uncurl!
                                Vain man, suppress that supercilious sneer,
                           For I have dared to love your matchless girl,
                              A fact well known to all my messmates here!</P>
